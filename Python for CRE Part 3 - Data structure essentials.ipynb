    "## Basic data types\n",
    "\n",
    "The three basic types of data:\n",
    "- **Scalars** are single values\n",
    "- **Strings** are single sets of letters\n",
    "- **Data structures** are sets of scalars and strings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scalars\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a single value and can full under a few different *types*:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **int** refers to an integer. **Examples:** 1, 42, 1571\n",
    "- **float** is a floating doint decimal approximation of a value. This is often what we work with. **Examples:** 1.0, 3.14159,20.11111\n",
    "- **complex** refers to complex numbers that have an imaginary part. **Examples:** 4.2 + 6i. *Note: Python displays a 'j' instead of an 'i'*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "**str** refers to a 'string' of characters. These are declared in Python with single, double, or triple quotes. Often it will not matter which convention you use, but there are specific exceptions. Technically a string is not a 'scalar,' but for simplicity  **Examples:** 'A',\"Penguin\",''''Kevin the Penguin'''\n",
    "\n",
    "Another data type that is sort of an integer and sort of a string is a Boolean or **bool**. This is a binary entity which can either be 'True' or 'False.' In Python we can also not that True=1 and False=0 or [].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Oftentimes we will work with collections of scalars or strings, but usually just scalars. There are ***many*** ways to organize and manipulate data, all with major or subtle pros and cons. We will only use a few:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lists** are the default data structure. They are built into the basic programming of Python. A list is **indexed**, meaning that each element has an assigned index value, **ordered** meaning that the precise order of these indices is important, and **mutable**, meaning that the contents can be changed after creation. These can contain scalars or strings or both. It is also possible to add or remove entries with certain commands.\n",
    "- **Tuples** are like lists, but they are **immutable** meaning they can not be altered after creation-they can only be overwritten\n",
    "- **Dictionaries** are like lists but are **not ordered** and inlcude **keys** that can be used to access complex data with words rather than indices. A simple usage could be to create an atomic masses dictionary. Accessing the 'rhenium' entry could return 186.207.\n",
    "- **Numpy arrays** are mathematical arrays like those used by default in MATLAB and are **what we do most of our math with.** These are very similar to lists but are better suited for mathematical operations. They can have **multiple dimensions** and therefore also represent matrices. To use a numpy array, you have to first import the numpy package.\n",
    "- **Pandas dataframes** are sort of a hybrid between dictionaries and numpy arrays. They allow for easy, fast math with large sets of indexed data, and the data can be easily manipulated. We might create, for example, a dataframe containing columns of reaction times, conversions, concentrations, and selectivities. We can use these to quickly find the selectivity of a specific species at a specific time or even the selectivity of a species at a certain conversion.\n"

    "    print('\\n x_tuple is a,'type(x_tuple))\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now it is important to understand **indexing**. The **Python convention is to start with index 0 rather than 1**, in constrast to some other languages such as MATLAB. To find the first element of each, use square brackets to select element 0:\n",
    "\n",
    "    print('\\n The first element of x_list is',x_list[0])\n",
    "    print('\\n The second element of x_tuple is',x_tuple[1])\n",

    "The value of an element can be reassigned in a list but not in a tuple. For example, the third element (index 2) of the list can be changed to 100 as follows:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    x_list[2] = 100\n",
    "    print('\\n Now x_list is',x_list)\n",
    "    \n",
    "The same command for the tuple will not work.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add an element to a list, you can use **append**. Python sometimes uses **dot notation** to access **methods** like this. For example, we can add a fifth element equal to 45 to the list as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    x_list.append(45)\n",
    "    print('\\n Now x_list is',x_list)\n",
    "    \n",
