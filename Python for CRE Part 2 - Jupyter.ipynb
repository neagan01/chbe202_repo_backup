    "## Project Jupyter\n",

    "Sounds cool, right? The \"Ju\" references the \"Julia\" coding language, the \"Py\" references \"Python\" (which itself is a references to \"Monty Python\"), and \"Ter\" is a reference to \"R\" while also spelling out a cool word which is a reference to Galileo and his discovery of the Moons of Jupiter as detailed in his own (less-sophisticated) notebooks. https://jupyter.org/ \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Jupyter to write Python codes, but (as the name suggests) you can write with a variety of languages such as Julia, which is faster than Python and better with handling memory, making it a better candidate for working with large data sets such as in  machine learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Literate programming\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter Notebook is a live document which brings together code annotation cells in the \"Markdown\" format (how this was written), code cells, and code cell outputs all in one place. This type of programming is often called \"literate\" programming because it is easier to read. Compared to a collection of simple executable .py files, this form makes it easier to understand what everything in a code is, why it is, and what it does. This facilitates sharing of codes and ideas especially among those like me who use coding simply as one of many tools for their work (rather than a data scientist). Data scientists may find interpreting a code trivial and would never have the time to annotate tens of thousands of lines of code to our hundreds.\n",

    "## Jupyter Notebook\n",

    "A Jupyter Notebook itself can be opened and run using the \"Jupyter Notebook\" app on your computer. When you go, it will open a window in your default browser in a default directory (unless you change it). Then you can open up a notebook from the file explorer.\n",

    "- Codefolding\n",
    "- Live Markdown Preview\n",
    "- Variable Inspector\n",
    "- Toggle all line numbers\n",

    "## JupyterLab\n",
    "\n",
    "This new Jupyter IDE provides a file browser, multiple tabs, and the ability to open a few different file types other than notebooks, inlcuding text files, markdown, and Python codes. You can also open a terminal. In the terminal you can then run Python files by starting with the \"python\" command.\n",

    "Many of the extensions I had to add to Jupyter Notebooks with nbextensions are embedded into JupyterLab and can be selected in Settings under \"Advanced Settings Editor.\" Putting in places to collapse code is still a bit tricky, however. As of now, only full cells can be collapsed. In Markdown cells, on the other hand, headers (lines starting with one or more #) can be easily collapsed. Not that it's very helpful in this case."
